Ok, then give me a customized checker code like the below example 2, but for this problem.
Note 0: The problem input, and both user's and judge's output would be passed as full text (string) in args. You must name the main checking function 'check', and its format should follow (problem_input : str, output_user : str, output_judge : str) -> str
Note 1: If the statement says that it has multiple testcase, the Input/Outputs of all testcases would be passed all at once.
Note 2: We know that output_judge is a 100% correct output (You can use it to simplify your code and save time implementing the solution yourself).
Note 3: You should return ("AC") (without redundant characters) if the test is passed, and return the fail reason if it fail.

# Example 2 (customized checker): Input C, output A, B such that A+B=C
import sys
def check(problem_input : str, output_user : str, output_judge : str) -> str:
    # output_judge is not important, we can directly check if the input satisfy
    C = int(problem_input)
    A, B = int(output_user.split())
    if A + B == C:
        return 'AC' # simply return 'AC' if it's correct
    else:
        return f"Incorrect. Sum is {A+B}, not{C}" # otherwise, return the reason that it fail
