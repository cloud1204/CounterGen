Ok, then give me a customized checker like the below example (read problem_input, output_user, output_judge from sys.argv), but for this problem.
Note 0: The problem input, and both user's and judge's output would be passed as full text (string) in args.
Note 1: If the statement says that it has multiple testcase, you should read them all.
Note 2: We know that output_judge is a 100% correct output (You can use it to simplify your code and save time implementing the solution yourself).
Note 3: You should print ("AC") (without redundant outputs) if the test is passed, and print the fail reason if it fail.
# Example 2 (customized checker): Input C, output A, B such that A+B=C
import sys
if __name__ == '__main__':
    problem_input = sys.argv[1]
    output_user = sys.argv[2]
    output_judge = sys.argv[3]
    # output_judge is not important, we can directly check if the input satisfy
    C = int(problem_input)
    A, B = int(output_user.split())
    if A + B == C:
        print('AC')
    else:
        print(f"Incorrect. Sum is {A+B}, not{C}")
