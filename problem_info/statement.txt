Alice got a permutation $$$a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$$$ of $$$[1,2,\ldots,n]$$$, and Bob got another permutation $$$b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$$$ of $$$[1,2,\ldots,n]$$$. They are going to play a game with these arrays.</p><p>In each turn, the following events happen in order:</p><ul> <li> Alice chooses either the first or the last element of her array and removes it from the array; </li><li> Bob chooses either the first or the last element of his array and removes it from the array. </li></ul><p>The game continues for $$$n-1$$$ turns, after which both arrays will have exactly one remaining element: $$$x$$$ in the array $$$a$$$ and $$$y$$$ in the array $$$b$$$.</p><p>If $$$x=y$$$, Bob wins; otherwise, Alice wins.
